## Quick Start

Eager to get started? This section gives a good introduction to set up OneMDM and run the server on your local machine.

#### Setting up OneMDM Server

OneMDM server uses PostgreSQL as database. Install PostgreSQL if it is not installed already:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-server-dev-9.3
```

Clone the repo and install the gems:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/multunus/onemdm-server.git
cd onemdm-server
bundle install
```

Create `database.yml`. And example file is provided in the `config` directory. Also, update the PostgreSQL username and password in the file:

``` bash
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
```

Create and migrate database:

``` bash
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

Run the server:

``` bash
rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

Now head over to [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin), and you see your OneMDM dashboard.

#### Setting up OneMDM Client

One MDM Client is the android application to run on the client device to communicate with the One MDM Server. Follow these [instructions to set up OneMDM Client](https://github.com/multunus/onemdm-client/blob/master/README.md)

## Features

Features which are currently available :

* **Tracking Device Status**

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Looking to contribute something to OneMDM? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to read the below information in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Bug Reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

1. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

## Contributing
